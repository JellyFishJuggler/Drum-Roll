# Drum Roll

This project is being developed as part of the Angela Yu course on web development.

 The goal of this project is to create a web application that simulates a drum kit. Users will be able to play different drum sounds by clicking on the corresponding drum pads on the screen. 
 
 The project will involve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing drum kit.
